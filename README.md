# marun oil field analysis

one of the most prevalent problem in the drilling industry is lost circulation which causes intense increase in drilling expenditure as well as operational obstacles such as well instability and blowout.

## idea
to re-evaluate and sieve out the significant features in `marun_sample2.csv` we will build 2 fundamental machine learning models - linear regression & classification and regression tree (cart), each choosing an optimal model for deployment. then, apply these models on the testset to obtain their root mean squared error (rmse) for final comparison.

## workflow
1. data preprocessing
2. exploratory data analysis
3. model building
4. model deployment
5. model comparison with rmse
